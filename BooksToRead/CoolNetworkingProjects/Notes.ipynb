    "\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "target_host = \"www.google.com\"\n",
    "target_port = 80\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a socket object\n",
    "client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n",
    "\n",

    "`client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)` : Here we are passing `AF_INET` i.e. Address Family of `IPv4` if we want to use `IPv6` then would have used `AF_INET6` and type of connection i.e. `TCP` or `UDP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `client.send(b\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: google.com\\r\\n\\r\\n\")` we use the `b` to encode our text to bytes because network communication happens in `bytes`.\n",

    "### **Receving Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "`response = client.recv(4096)`: We are passing the buffer size or byte size we want to receive in a single call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are creating a buffer of `4096` bytes i.e. `4Kb` of our RAM. So, we can only receive only max of `4Kb` in a single call.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are requesting a `server` for a page whose size is `100MB` then we will have to loop the `.recv()` repeatedly to read the full `100MB` response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `Content-Length: 104857600` in the response header means that the server wants to send us `100MB` of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why can't we receive everything in one go?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because TCP is a stream-oriented protocol, not message oriented. Data flows in chunks. As we receive packets in chunks.\n",

Then `client_socket.recv(1024)` it is a I/O blocking task which freezes the Main Thread until the message is received from the client due to which other connection request are blocked. The `accept` function returns a tuple consisting (client_socket, client_address)\n",
    "\n",
    "The client can take any time to send the data therefore we use `multithreading` for the `client_socket.recv(1024)` function which freezes the `main` thread and allows to accept other connection request.\n",

    "\n",
    "If Netcat is missing from a system but Python is available, you can use Python to create similar networking tools for file transfer or remote access. This is especially useful for penetration testers or hackers trying to maintain access stealthily, and it's also a great learning exercise for anyone studying Python and networking.\n"
